Secure Apex Code with User Mode Database Operations

Apex runs in system mode by default, which means that it runs with substantially elevated privilages
over the user running the code

To enhance the security of Apex, you can specify user mode access for database operations
Field-level secuirty (FLS) and object permissions of the running user are respected in
user mode, unlike system mode

Examples:

SOQL:
List<Account> acc = [SELECT Id FROM Account WITH USER_MODE];

DML:
Account acc = new Account(Name = 'Test Account');
insert as user acc;

Database Methods:
Database.query(query, AccessLevel.USER_MODE);
