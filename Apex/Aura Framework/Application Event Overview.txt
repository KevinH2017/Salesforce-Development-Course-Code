Application Event:

An application event can be handled by any aura component regardless of the component hierarchy
Components should be on the same page


Fire Application Event Example:

const appEvent = $A.get("e.c:appEvent");

appEvent.setParams({"myParam" : myValue});

appEvent.fire();


Handle Application Event Example:

<aura:handler event="c:appEvent" action="{!c.handleApplicationEvent}" />
