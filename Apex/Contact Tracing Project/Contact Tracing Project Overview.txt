Contact Tracing is a feature in Salesforce that helps keep track of individuals who may have been exposed to a contagious disease, such as COVID-19. 
It allows organizations to quickly identify and notify potentially affected individuals, helping to prevent further spread of the disease.

It is no longer available in Salesforce as of Winter 2022 release.
