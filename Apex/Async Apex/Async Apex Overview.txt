Async Apex

Apex code can run asycnhronously, meaning it doesn't have to wait for one process to finish in order to move to the next one

Example:

Start Operation --> Process Starts --> Error Occurred --> Operation Ends
                                            ---> When error occurs, send to error logging system instead of abruptly ending operation

Advantages of Async Apex:

- Runs in the background
- Higher governor limits
- Can be scheduled
- Can process more number of records
