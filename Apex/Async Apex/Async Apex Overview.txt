Async Apex

Apex code can run asycnhronously, meaning it doesn't have to wait for one process to finish in order to move to the next one

Apex Jobs can be found in Setup --> Search --> Apex Jobs

In the Setup it shows the Submitted Date, Job Type, Status, Status Details, Total Batches, Batches Processed,
Failures, Submitted By, Completion Date, Apex Class, Apex Method, and Apex Job ID

Example:

Start Operation --> Process Starts --> Error Occurred --> Operation Ends
                                            ---> When error occurs, send to error logging system instead of abruptly ending operation

Advantages of Async Apex:

- Runs in the background
- Higher governor limits
- Can be scheduled
- Can process more number of records
