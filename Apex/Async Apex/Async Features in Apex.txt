Async Features:

Future Methods:

- Runs in their own thread, and does not start until resources are available
- Commonly used in web service callouts

Batch Apex:

- Run large jobs that would exceed normal processing limits
- Such as data cleansing or achiving of records

Queueable Apex:

- Similar to future methods, but provides additional job chaining and allowing more complex data types to be used
- Used to perform sequential processing operations with external web services
- You can specify a delay in scheduling queueable jobs with a specified minimum delay (0-10 minutes)
    - However, the delay is ignored during Apex testing

Scheduled Apex:

- To schedule apex to run at a specified time
- Like daily or weekly tasks
