Governor Limits are a set of rules in Salesforce that restrict the amount of resources that can be consumed by a single transaction. 
These limits help ensure that no single transaction monopolizes shared resources, which could lead to performance issues or system instability. 
Understanding and working within these limits is crucial for developing efficient Apex code.

Certain design patterns should be used, such as bulk calls and foreign key relationships in queries.
Most of the governor limits are per transaction, and some aren't, such as 24-hour limits.
