What is an Apex Trigger?

Apex triggers are pieces of code that execute auotmatically in response to certain events on Salesforce objects

They are similar to database triggers where you want to perform certain actions on data manipulation events

Apex triggers also allows you to perform custom actions before or after changes to Salesforce records

The code block of a trigger cannot contain the static keyowrd

You do not have to manually commit any database changes made by a trigger

Apex trigger types:
